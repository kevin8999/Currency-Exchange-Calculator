# Currency Exchange Calculator
This calculator takes in any piece of text and replaces the text inside it with the valid currency.

For example, suppose you want to convert EUR to USD, and you have this piece of text:

```plain
The car costs â‚¬10 000.
```

This program will output the following:

```plain
The car costs $10 389.
```

Note that the above assumes that 1 EUR = 1.0389 USD.

## Important Notes
For information about supported currencies, please see https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/supported-currencies.

Additionally, this program will break if run on text such as the following:

```plain
25 USD 15
3 $5
```

This is because the program is unsure if the currency symbol belongs to the number before it or the number after it.
